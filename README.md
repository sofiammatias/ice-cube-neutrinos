The goal of this competition from Kaggle is to predict/estimate **neutrino particle's direction** by developing a model based on data from the "IceCube" detector, which observes the cosmos from deep within the South Pole ice. This work could help scientists better understand exploding stars, gamma-ray bursts, and cataclysmic phenomena involving black holes, neutron stars and the fundamental properties of the neutrino itself.

Researchers have developed multiple approaches over the past ten years to reconstruct neutrino events. However, problems arise as existing solutions are far from perfect. They're either fast but inaccurate or more accurate at the price of huge computational costs. The **IceCube Neutrino Observatory** is the first detector of its kind, encompassing a cubic kilometer of ice and designed to search for the nearly massless neutrinos. An international group of scientists is responsible for the scientific research that makes up the IceCube Collaboration.

By making the process faster and more precise, it's possible to improve the reconstruction of neutrinos. As a result, we could gain a clearer image of our universe.

When detection events can be localized quickly enough, traditional telescopes are recruited to investigate short-lived neutrino sources such as supernovae or gamma ray bursts. Because the sky is huge better localization will not only associate neutrinos with sources but also to help partner observatories limit their search space. With an average of **three thousand events per second** to process, it's difficult to keep up with the stream of data using traditional methods. The main challenge in this competition is to quickly and accurately process a large number of events.

This competition used a hidden test set of roughly one million events, split between multiple batches.

# Objectives

The main objective of this challenge is to predict a neutrino's direction in a timely manner, processing millions of rows in a short period of time. 

The evaluation function is the mean F2 score. The F2 score comes from a generalized form of F score in terms of 'beta':

treamline the process of matching educational content to specific topics in a curriculum. To achieve that, an accurate and efficient model needs to be developed and trained on a library of K-12 educational materials that have been organized into a variety of topic taxonomies.

These materials are in diverse languages, and cover a wide range of topics, particularly in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).

The dataset presented is drawn from the Kolibri Studio curricular alignment tool, in which users can create their own channel, then build out a topic tree that represents a curriculum taxonomy or other hierarchical structure, and finally organize content items into these topics, by uploading their own content and/or importing existing materials from the Kolibri Content Library of Open Educational Resources. The leaf topic in this branch might then contain (be correlated with) a content item such as a video entitled Polar Coordinates.
